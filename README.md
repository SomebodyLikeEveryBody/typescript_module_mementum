# typescript_module_mementum
Typescript memetum to remember how to split code into several files without using module feature witch prohibit the local use with file:// protocole because of the Same Origin Policy.

It's a pity that javascript modules are always loaded using http instead of the currently used procole (http if the application uses http://, file if the applications uses file:// etc) as it does for all html ressources.
